Today, we will explain in an easy way how to make Undetected Cheat Engine and build the driver easily and quickly.
We won't need to use the Hxd program to change the name of the Cheat Engine; instead, we will use a tool I've created to do all that with ease and speed.
We will provide a complete explanation today, and we will use Visual Studio 2022


*** I would like to note that the tool for changing names only works on the following version:

7.5 and 7.4

cheatengine-x86_64
cheatengine-x86_64-SSE4-AVX2

It does not work on version 32 of cheatengine






*
Here I built the driver and changed the texts in just 4 minutes and I experimented. I also want to point out that I forgot to mention DBVM, it also works.

Cheat Engine Undetected test :




------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Step 1:

First, we will download Visual Studio 2022 from the Microsoft website.

from here :
here : https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/wi...wnload-the-wdk

Download Visual Studio Community 2022 and select the Desktop development with C++
After that, go to the "Individual components" section and make sure to install:

MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 build tools (Latest)
MSVC v143 - VS 2022 C++ x64/x86 Spectre-mitigated libs (Latest)

* Follow the instructions on the Microsoft website to step 3

Step 2: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 SDK

Step 3: Install Windows 11, version 22H2 WDK

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 4:

Download the cheat engine from the official website

here :
https://www.cheatengine.org/

and Install the cheat engine

Cheat Engine will be installed, and it will appear on your desktop. Right-click on it, and then select "Open file location."
Copy all the files related to Cheat Engine and create a new folder in any location, for example, on your desktop, and name it with any desired name. Place the copied files inside the folder.
After copying all the files, now we need to uninstall Cheat Engine from the programs.
We will go to the folder where we placed the files and delete the following files: (dbk64.cepack) and (dbk32.cepack) because they are detected by Anti-Cheat .

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 5 :

Download the driver for the cheat engine from github we need just ( DBKKernel )
here : https://github.com/cheat-engine/cheat-engine

We only need the DBKKernel folder, so we will place it on the desktop or any location of your choice.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Step 6:

use Edit Cheat Engine

Tool properties:

1- Change the name of Cheat Engine to a random name or any name you prefer.
2- You can quickly and easily change the name of the DBK64 file within the driver to any name you prefer, and you won't need to edit it within Visual Studio.
3- Create a .dat file, which, in turn, will make Cheat Engine recognize the driver after building.
4- Edit the project
This option will make some modifications to the driver's project before opening it in Visual Studio, and it will do the following:
TargetVersion : Windows 7
TargetName : dbk64
OutDir : Path to save the driver after building the project
TreatWarningAsError : yes
post-bulid-event : signtool.exe" sign /a /ac "$(TargetDir)..

* It will automatically change it to:

TargetVersion : Windows10
TargetName : our driver name
OutDir : Path to save the driver after building the project
TreatWarningAsError : no
Delete the line : signtool.exe" sign /a /ac "$(TargetDir)..

5- Create a shortcut for building the driver without the need to open Visual Studio. It will build the driver in the command prompt.
Make sure you have completed all the previous steps and chosen the "Edit the project" option to avoid errors.
Also, select the version you have, whether Visual Studio 2022 or 2019.




1-

Press the button Open Cheat Engine and select cheatengine-x86_64 or cheatengine-x86_64-SSE4-AVX2 to change the name 'Cheat Engine' to a random name ,
You can name it whatever you like, but it's important to keep the same number of characters in the name.

2-

Modify the driver to change the name 'DBK64' to another name and save it
In the DBK64 driver option, click the "Open File" button, then navigate to the DBKKernel folder, select the DBK64.ini file for editing. Enter the driver's name and finally, save it.

3-

Edit the project

Click the "Open Project" button and choose DBKKernel.sln. In the "Save Driver In" option, specify the path where you want to save the driver after building , Then click the "Save" button.

4-

use Edit Cheat Engine to create a dat file for our driver

Ensure that you use the same driver name and input a random service name â€“ it doesn't matter. Check the box for "Random," then save it inside the Cheat Engine folder.
The driver name must ultimately include ".sys"

5-

Create a shortcut for building the driver without the need to open Visual Studio. It will build the driver in the command prompt
Make sure you have completed all the previous steps and chosen the "Edit the project" option to avoid errors
Also, select the version you have, whether Visual Studio 2022 or 2019.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

* I built the tool inside Visual Studio 2022 and made some modifications to a few lines to make it work correctly. The tool is not my own creation.

Step 7 :

DSE-Patcher

After you have built your driver and everything is complete, now we will use the DSE-Patcher (Driver Signature Enforcement) tool, which, in turn, will disable DSE to allow us to load any unsigned driver.
All you need to do is click the "Disable" button, and after that, click the "Enable" button once you're done.




Make sure, after finishing the driver installation, to re-enable DSE.
